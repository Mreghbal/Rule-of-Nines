# Rule-of-Nines
Python code for calculating burn area using the Rule of Nines in actual conditions.
In this code, the calculate_burn_area function takes the patient's age and weight as input. It first checks if the age is within the valid range of 1 to 100 and if the weight is greater than zero. Then, it uses the Rule of Nines percentages for different body parts to calculate the total body surface area. Finally, it calculates the burn percentage by multiplying the age ratio and weight ratio with the total body surface area.

You can run this code and provide the patient's age and weight as input to get the estimated burn area percentage based on the Rule of Nines.
